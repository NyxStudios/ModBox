# ModBox

ModBox is the next-generation of Terraria modding. ModBox aims to allow servers and clients to have a completely new experience, replacing as much Terraria with custom content as possible. Join a server with a vanilla ModBox client, and download custom sprites, music, and game rules. While [TShock](https://github.com/NyxStudios/TShock) is our premier offering server software for stock clients, ModBox aims to deliver a better experience by controlling both the server and the client. 

## Client & Piracy

In order to deter piracy, we will not be providing the content from Terraria to non-paying customers of Re-Logic. We do not intend on encouraging piracy; if anything, we may require clients to have Steam, and to be properly authenticated with a valid copy through Steam in order to use ModBox.
